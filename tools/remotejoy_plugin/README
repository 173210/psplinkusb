RemoteJoy Plugin v1.0 (c) TyRaNiD 2007

This is a version of remotejoy which doesn't require psplink to operate.

To use copy this and usbhostfs.prx to your plugins dir and enable them.
If you want to use it in pops mode you also need to take a copy of usb.prx
from the firmware and enable that as an extra plugin module.
